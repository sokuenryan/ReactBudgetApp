    used in the react-router-budget-app VScode file.

    - Working on a way to get the bill-content class to expapnd with 
    the number of added bills. 
    - Considered making it so that after a certain number of bills were submitted,
    it would switch pages. Wanted the data to also be printed to the Calendar on the
    next tab. 
    - Still haven't yet decided if I am going to follow the UXUI wireframe in that 
    regard yet.

    - I am adding an dropdown menu for weeks 1 - 4 in replacement of dropdown 
    'categories' 

Last given action on 6/27/2024
    - Currrently restructuring the Recent Bills Menu to look a bit more neat when 
    there is mass amount of data printed. 
    - Need to get a client side server up so that the data can save itself and not be 
    deleted when refreshed. 

    - Hopefully soon I will be able to duplicate everything into the next 2 buttons: 
    Investments and Credit. But before that I need to be able to have the table 
    update itself and to be able to have the table do that, I need to have a Client 
    side server be able to run CRUD.

    - Had trouble getting the percentage to update on the other component, so I just 
    included it in the same one. 
    - Figured it would also be more time effiecient 
    anyways and I figured the design was already a bit different anyways with the
    "week" dropdown menu.

    - I had just restructued the Create New Bills page, changed up the dimensions and 
    the colors a bit. It's now working beautifly. 
    - I have just made it so that the fractions can be calculated successfuly out of 
    total bills. 
    - My next action I need to do is get it to print out a whole number under 
    'Bill Left'. 

Last given action 7/2/2024
    - I completed the Create New Bills tab area of the Bills Section. 
    - Currently working on the Calendar Tab.
    - successfully added the react-calendar to the application and styled it. 
    The next thing I need to work on is getting whatever bills are printed out in the 
    "Bill List" section to show up on the next tab in the designated dates given. 
    - Hopefully after I can duplicate most of this code into the Investments and Credit 
    area and then the whole project is completed!

    - I had a slight issue last night with git push due to changing the repo name.
    - It was saying something about not having some things saved locally and this
    being due to the fact that there were more than one repo being pushed by the same 
    ref. 
    - I had to do a git pull before doing a git push and then it worked. 
 
Last given action 7/4/2024
    - A bit of screwing around with things. I need to do more styling since I edited
     it a lot mostly with the bill list area. 
    - Calendar does print out to it, but does not update when deleting or editing. 
    - SAVE THIS TO YOUR REPO ASAP!

    - Spent most the shift getting the react-calendar to work. 
    - BUG 1: wasn't printing to the calendar 

    - BUG 2: When it did print to the calendar, it didn't change when I edited 
    or deleted the data. 
    - Tried to edit the handleEdit and the handleDelete added several different
    lines of code
    - Went through several copy and pastings from github to reset, 
    - Turned to AI for help with debugging
    - Ended up deleting several conversation when it got to messy and the AI I believe
    was causing more issues.

    - Started on the new tab called "investment" but there were a lot of naming 
    issues with the classnames. 
    - Duplicated most of the code from the Bills.jsx over to the investment 
    portion of the application, but it still needs some major fix ups. 
    Removed 3 major components: The week dropdown-menu, the date input, and the 
    child compoent Calendar mainly associated with the parent component of Bills.jsx.

    - Calendar got screwed up on styling  at some point. 
    - The several duplication attempts to take the code from the bills section
    to the investments section seemed to create more issues.  
    - The calendar styles were not being registered and the reason 
    - The reason was I had imported the react-calendar/dist/Calendar.css file
    from node_modules and it was overriding my styles. 
    - But it was working fine before.

 - created the Credit page. 
 - created the Investments page. 

Last Given action of 07/16/2024
    - I have successfully started implementing the plans into place
    - I added a new tab page to both Investment and Credit called Existing
    Investments or Existing Credit. 
    - Existing Investments can so far print the name and the amount from 
    the Create NewInvestment Data onto it. 
    - I also inplmented a working contribute and edit button. 
    - Contribute button can add numbers but cannot save the data. 
    - Edit button can edit the number contributed successfully and has 
    an 'update' button. 
    - Edit button needs CSS styling
    - The Existing Credit needs the same features as the Existing Investments
    so Once I finish with that I will copy and paste the similar features to 
    Existing Credit and alt what is needed.
    - Added a banner so you can't add any contribution number that exeeds
    that of the current Investment
