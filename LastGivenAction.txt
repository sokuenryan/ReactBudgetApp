that I had used in the react-router-budget-app vs code file.

I was looking for a way to get the bill-content class to expapnd with the number of added bills 
and eventually I wanted, after a certain number was submitted, to have it switch pages and or be printed to the Calendar on the next tab. 
Still haven't yet decided if I am going to follow the UXUI wireframe in that regard yet.
