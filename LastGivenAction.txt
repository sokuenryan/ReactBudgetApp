I was looking to find out how to make my bills print out the bottom using similar code
that I had used in the react-router-budget-app vs code file.

I was looking for a way to get the bill-content class to expapnd with the number of added bills 
and eventually I wanted, after a certain number was submitted, to have it switch pages and or be printed to the Calendar on the next tab. 
Still haven't yet decided if I am going to follow the UXUI wireframe in that regard yet.

I am adding an dropdown menu for weeks 1 - 4 in replacement of dropdown 'categories'

I am restructuring the Recent Bills Menu to look a bit more neat when there is mass amount of data printed
The next thing I am going to do is get a client side server up so that the data can save 
itself and not be deleted when refreshed. 
Hopefully soon I will be able to duplicate everything into the next 2 buttons: Investments
and Credit. But before that I need to be able to have the table update itself and to
be able to have the table do that, I need to have a Client side server be able to 
run CRUD.

Had trouble getting the percentage to update on the other component, so I just included it in the same one. 
I figured it would also be more time effiecient anyways and I figured the design was alreadya  bit different anyways
with the "week" dropdown menu.

I had just restructued the Create New Bills page, changed up the dimensions and the colors a bit
It's now working beautifly. 
I have just made it so that the fractions can be calculated successfuly out of total bills. 
My next action I need to do is get it to print out a whole number under 'Bill Left'.

I completed the Create New Bills tab area of the Bills Section. 
I am now working on the Calendar Tab. I successfully added the react-calendar to
the application and styled it. The next thing I need to work on is getting whatever
bills are printed out in the Bill List section to show up on the next tab in the 
designated dates given. 
Hopefully after I can duplicate most of this code into the Investments and Credit area
and then the whole project is completed!

I had a slight issue last night with git push due to changing the repo name.
It was saying something about not having some things saved locally and this
being due to the fact that there were more than one repo being pushed by the same 
ref. I had to do a git pull before doing a git push and then it worked.

A bit of screwing things. I need to do more styling since I edited it a lot mostly 
with the bill list area. 
Calendar does print out to it, but does not update when deleting or editing. 
SAVE THIS TO YOUR REPO ASAP!
