I was looking to find out how to make my bills print out the bottom using similar code
that I had used in the react-router-budget-app vs code file.

I was looking for a way to get the bill-content class to expapnd with the number of added bills 
and eventually I wanted, after a certain number was submitted, to have it switch pages and or be printed to the Calendar on the next tab. 
Still haven't yet decided if I am going to follow the UXUI wireframe in that regard yet.

I am adding an dropdown menu for weeks 1 - 4 in replacement of dropdown 'categories'

I am restructuring the Recent Bills Menu to look a bit more neat when there is mass amount of data printed
The next thing I am going to do is get a client side server up so that the data can save 
itself and not be deleted when refreshed. 
Hopefully soon I will be able to duplicate everything into the next 2 buttons: Investments
and Credit. But before that I need to be able to have the table update itself and to
be able to have the table do that, I need to have a Client side server be able to 
run CRUD.

Had trouble getting the percentage to update on the other component, so I just included it in the same one. 
I figured it would also be more time effiecient anyways and I figured the design was alreadya  bit different anyways
with the "week" dropdown menu.

I had just restructued the Create New Bills page, changed up the dimensions and the colors a bit
It's now working beautifly. 
I have just made it so that the fractions can be calculated successfuly out of total bills. 
My next action I need to do is get it to print out a whole number under 'Bill Left'.
